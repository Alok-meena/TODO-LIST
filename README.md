# TODO-LIST

This is a basic site where the user is allowed to create their own data and the user can edit or delete the data .
The data will be presented in the list format and the user also have the choice to delete , edit and drag the list items.

You can view the site and can create your own todo-items by clicking here:----------------https://alok-meena.github.io/TODO-LIST/

It is created using html , css and javascript.

I had learnt MERN STACK course from CODING BLOCKS.
